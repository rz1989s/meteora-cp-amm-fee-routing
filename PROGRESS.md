## 🔄 Phase 3: Integration Testing (In Progress)

**Status**: Just starting
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours

### Goals
- [ ] Create test fixtures (mock Meteora pool, Streamflow streams)
- [ ] Test position initialization flow
- [ ] Test fee claiming flow
- [ ] Test distribution calculations
- [ ] Test pagination and idempotency
- [ ] Test 24h time gate enforcement
- [ ] Test edge cases (dust, caps, all unlocked)

### Current Blockers
None - ready to start

---

## ⏳ Phase 4: Devnet Deployment (Pending)

**Status**: Not started
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours

### Goals
- [ ] Deploy to devnet
- [ ] Test with real Meteora DAMM V2 pools
- [ ] Test with real Streamflow streams
- [ ] Verify events emitted correctly
- [ ] Document deployment process

---

## ⏳ Phase 5: Documentation & Submission (Pending)

**Status**: Not started
**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 hours

### Goals
- [ ] Update README with final usage instructions
- [ ] Document test execution steps
- [ ] Add architecture diagrams (optional)
- [ ] Prepare bounty submission materials
- [ ] Final code review and optimization

## 📝 Notes

### DAMM V2 vs DLMM Clarification
- Bounty URL says "dlmm-v2" but content says "DAMM V2"
- Confirmed using DAMM V2 / CP-AMM (Constant Product AMM)
- Program ID: `cpamdpZCGKUy5JxQXB4dcpGPiikHawvSWAd6mEn1sGG` ✅
- See `archive/CRITICAL_CORRECTION.md` for full details

### Quote-Only Strategy
- DAMM V2 accrues fees in BOTH token A and token B
- Strategy: Accept both, distribute token B (quote) only
- Token A accumulates in treasury (can be swapped later)
