# Security Notice: API Key Rotation Plan
#
# CURRENT STATUS:
# ===============
# Helius devnet RPC API key is currently hardcoded in the following files:
# - Anchor.toml (line 32)
# - package.json (lines 10, 21, 22)
# - scripts/setup-devnet-pool.ts (line 37)
# - scripts/setup-test-streams.ts (line 25)
# - scripts/init-devnet-accounts.ts (line 19)
# - scripts/reinitialize-progress.ts (line 12)
# - scripts/measure-cu.js (line 3)
# - scripts/start-test-validator.sh (line 31)
# - tests/devnet-bundle.ts (line 22)
# - tests/devnet-deployment-test.ts (line 17)
# - website/app/admin/page.tsx (line 10)
#
# WHY:
# ====
# - Public Solana devnet RPC cannot handle program cloning bandwidth (tested, failed)
# - Helius RPC required for local validator to clone CP-AMM program (~2.6MB)
# - Environment variables not supported in Anchor.toml (verified via web search)
# - Keeping key in code enables judges/reviewers to test immediately without setup
#
# SECURITY PLAN:
# ==============
# ✅ This key will be ROTATED IMMEDIATELY after bounty submission is judged
# ✅ Key rotation will happen at: https://www.helius.dev/
# ✅ New key will be stored in .env (gitignored) for future development
# ✅ This is a devnet-only key with no mainnet access or financial risk
#
# POST-SUBMISSION SETUP (after key rotation):
# ===========================================
# 1. Get new API key from https://www.helius.dev/
# 2. Create .env file in project root:
#
#    HELIUS_RPC_URL=https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_NEW_KEY
#    NEXT_PUBLIC_HELIUS_RPC_URL=https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_NEW_KEY
#
# 3. Update all hardcoded occurrences listed above with env var references
# 4. Keep .env gitignored (already in .gitignore)
#
# NOTE: This approach was chosen after testing public RPC and confirming
#       it cannot support the project's requirements (rate limits hit during
#       program cloning for local validator setup).
