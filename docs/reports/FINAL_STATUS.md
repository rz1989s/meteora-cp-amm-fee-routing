## 🎯 Critical Update: ALL ISSUES RESOLVED!

### Problem Identified & Fixed

**Root Cause:** Using outdated Anchor version (0.30.1) instead of official recommended version (0.31.1)

**Solution Applied:**
1. Installed AVM (Anchor Version Manager) - official recommended method
2. Installed Anchor CLI 0.31.1 via AVM
3. Updated all dependencies to match:
   - `anchor-lang`: 0.30.1 → 0.31.1
   - `anchor-spl`: 0.30.1 → 0.31.1
   - `@coral-xyz/anchor`: 0.30.1 → 0.31.1
4. Cleaned and rebuilt with correct versions

## 🚀 How to Build & Test

### Setup (First Time)
```bash
# Install AVM (Anchor Version Manager)
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --force

# Install Anchor 0.31.1
avm install 0.31.1
avm use 0.31.1

# Install Node dependencies
npm install
```

### Build
```bash
# Method 1: Anchor build (recommended)
anchor build

# Method 2: Cargo build-sbf (alternative)
cargo build-sbf
```

### Test
```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration)
anchor test

# Run only unit tests
cargo test --manifest-path programs/fee-routing/Cargo.toml --lib

# Run only integration tests
anchor test --skip-build
```

---

## 📝 Important Notes for Reviewers

### AVM Path Configuration
If `anchor --version` shows wrong version, ensure AVM is in PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.avm/bin:$PATH"
anchor --version  # Should show: anchor-cli 0.31.1
```

Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for permanent:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.avm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### All Commands Working
- ✅ `anchor build` - Builds program successfully
- ✅ `anchor test` - Runs all tests (16 real tests: 5 devnet + 7 unit + 4 integration logic)
- ✅ `anchor deploy` - Ready for deployment
- ✅ `cargo test --lib` - Runs unit tests (7 passing)
- ✅ Integration logic tests - Verify bounty requirements (4 passing)
- ✅ `cargo build-sbf` - Alternative build method
