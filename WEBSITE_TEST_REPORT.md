## Issues Found

### Critical Issues
None ✅

### Medium Priority Issues

1. **Calculator Reactivity Bug**
   - **Location:** Home page (`/`)
   - **Issue:** Sliders move but calculated values don't update in real-time
   - **Expected:** When slider changes, all calculations should update immediately
   - **Actual:** Values remain static despite slider movement
   - **Root Cause:** Likely missing React state update in FeeCalculator component
   - **Fix Required:** Add proper useState/useEffect hooks to recalculate on slider change
   - **Workaround:** None (feature non-functional)
   - **Impact:** Demo feature doesn't work as intended for bounty reviewers

### Low Priority Issues

1. **Console Error: "Invalid or unexpected token"**
   - **Impact:** No visible UI issues
   - **Source:** Unknown (webpack/HMR related)
   - **Recommendation:** Investigate before production deployment

2. **Documentation Line Count Off by 1**
   - **Issue:** Website shows 1,063 but actual is 1,062
   - **Impact:** Negligible (rounding or trailing newline)
   - **Recommendation:** Update to 1,062 for accuracy

---
